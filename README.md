# 1. WHAT IS THIS?                   #
#------------------------------------#

Minion Invaders is a stand-alone game basing on two famous games:
"Space Invaders" and "League of Legends".
In this game you will play Sona (a League of Legends character) in
a Space Invaders environment.

The story to this game is short and simple: You are Sona - who is a
support champion in League of Legends - and Lux - who is a mage
champion in League of Legends - laughs about you because you are only
a weak supporter. Time to change this: Level yourself up until you
can defeat Lux!

After you have beaten Lux the story is over, but you can continue
the game in survival mode to see how far you can get!

This game should not take too much of your computer's resources.
We were not able to test everything but your computer should be fine
with:

-> Sven "svenofix" Zirkmann
Sven is a friend of mine, for this project I call him my graphic guy.
He helped me so much by getting, editing and even creating sprites
for this game! Thank you alot for all the help with the graphics!
Also a big thank you for all the playtesting since the very first
playable version to get a decent balancing and the bugs fixed.

-> "BluntBaron"
Thank you for betatesting and pointing out some weird bugs!

-> "Vesbazz"
Thank you for the great retro-style-remix of the LoL theme music!

-> Riot Games Inc.
Thank you for creating the game "League of Legends" where I obviously
stole some ideas from ;) Infact this game is actually a fanproject
for League of Legends.

I used the LWJGL as Game Library since Java has no native support for
OpenGL. If you want to learn more about LWJGL visit the official

-> About the game difficulty
This game is starting off very simple
but gets very difficult in the higher levels. Especially the final
fight versus Lux may take you several attempts and some time, but
it should be possible if you don't give up too fast.
Don't forget to use all your abilities wisely, then you should
succeed. I wanted to make it a challenge that satifies you when you
finally win it. So keep trying, Lux infact is beatable! Nobody said
that a supporter would have an easy time beating a mage ;)
UPDATE: As of version 1.2.0 there are different game difficulties,
so you shouldn't worry about this no more. Just pick easy if you
seem to be completely unable to play the game on medium or hard.

-> How long did it take me?
I had no plan about making this game. One evening with nothing to do
I just went like 'Hey, I make a game now!' and so I did. I did spend
pretty much all the time of the next 7 days on it, then I the game was
almost finished. After that I used some additional days for a closed beta
testing phase and some minor updates and fixes. Basically I
wanted to see how far I can go within one week of game developing.
I must also say that I never created any game before. Considering that,
I'm quite happy with the result. I'm going to release some updates
according to player feedback though, so let me know what you wish
to see changed or added in the game!

-> Why did I choose Sona as main character for the game?
Well, actually that wasn't even my decision. I just asked my friend
Sven like 'Hey, tell me a ranged LoL champion and I'm gonna make a
game of it' and he replied 'Sona'.

-> Do I play League of Legends?
Well, yeah. Otherwise I wouldn't make a fanproject about it, right?
If you wonder where you find me in League of Legends: I have accounts
with the summonername "Linnun" on EU-WEST aswell as on NA servers.
However, I usually only use my EU-WEST account, so if you really
want to contact me over LoL, EU-WEST servers are the way to go.

-> Feedback & Donations
All this game was made in my sparetime and I did it without any gains,
so if you'd like to support me, you're welcome for it. Contact me at
<minioninvaders@danielfigge.net> to talk about the details.
You can also send feedback and suggestions to that mail address!
