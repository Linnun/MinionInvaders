# MinionInvaders

Minion Invaders is a stand-alone game basing on two famous games: "Space Invaders" and "League of Legends". In this game you will play Sona (a League of Legends character) in a Space Invaders environment.
The story to this game is short and simple: You are Sona - who is a support champion in League of Legends - and Lux - who is a mage champion in League of Legends - laughs about you because you are only a weak supporter. Time to change this: Level yourself up until you can defeat Lux!
After you have beaten Lux the story is over, but you can continue the game in survival mode to see how far you can get!
